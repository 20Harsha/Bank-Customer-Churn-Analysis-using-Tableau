In the above dashboard we could simply select the values 0,1 from the number of years of tenure filter because we want to find out that how many customers exited the bank having tenure less than 1 or between 1 and 0 that is less than 1 year. Then we would simply filter gender by selecting on the donut chart first we filter for male then for female to observe the values. We could now observe that there were total 142 male customers who exited and total 185 female customers who exited. So compare to male customers female customers have high churn rate when we compare for tenure of less than or equal to 1 year.

When we talk about age range for male & female so we could basically observe the color shades darker the color more number of customers exited from that age range so when we hover over the darker bar for female customers we could observe that from age range 45 to 50 maximum female customers are about to churn. And when we talk about male customer age range 40 to 45 is there where male customers are about to churn mostly. 

**Q.11) Among male and female compare the total estimated salary for customers percentage wise?**

Ans. From the above analysis we found that exit percentage of male customer is 16.5% which is lower than exit percentage of female customer which is 25.1%. Also from the above analysis which we did we observed that female customers have high churn rate compare to male customers when we observed for the tenure of less than or equal to 1 year. Female customers have high churn rate in age range 45 to 50. Also estimated salary of female customers is lower than male customers and also  balance as well as credit score of female customers is lower so having lower balance in account as well as having lower estimated salary and lower credit score might be the reason why female customers have high churn rate. So from the above observations we conclude that female customers are more likely to churn compare to male customers.
